Water distribution systems are used to supply water to different consumers and/or locations. They can be used for different purposes, including irrigation, reclaimed water distribution, waste water disposal, etc. Pipeline networks are composed of source nodes and demand nodes that are connected by pipes. Optional junction nodes can be used to further decrease the length of pipes used for the network. The optimal locations of these junction nodes can be represented as Steiner points in the Steiner Tree problem which is heavily studied in computer science and optimization. However, water distribution pipeline layouts are also affected by other constraints such as pressure requirements on demand nodes and pressure loss in pipes. These different constraints contribute to the difficulty of the optimization problem.
